# SQLame
That's my attempt to create most Lame, and propably slowest database.

## Idea
Main idea is to create database engine which allows to store data.

But worse.

## Connection mechanism
I want it to provide TCP connection, by this I mean HTTPS, and rest API

## Querries
As name of this project suggest I want it to be `SQL'ish` - but worse. It won't be pure `SQL` syntax, but `SQL` in `JSON`.

```json
{
    "select" : {
        "what": "*",
        "from": "my_table",
        "where": "id > 2"
    }
}
```
